## Working Papers

### Paper 1: A Benchmark for Few-Shot Catastrophe Prevention Techniques
**Status:** In development (v0.1)
**Expected:** 2026

Systematic evaluation framework comparing different catastrophe prevention techniques (probes, fine-tuning, monitoring). Building on validated pilot studies to understand the fundamental tradeoffs between control and alignment.

## Pilot Studies

### Catastrophe Prevention Pilot (December 2025)
**Result:** GO decision - benchmark produces meaningful signal

Validated that the benchmark framework can distinguish between effective and ineffective prevention techniques:
- Baseline: 32% (control condition)
- Probe intervention: 32% (failed - no improvement)
- Fine-tuning intervention: 18% (succeeded - significant improvement)

### Psychometric Variance Pilot (December 2025)
**Result:** Hypothesis falsified (r = -0.29, p = 0.49)

Initial hypothesis about psychometric variance and AI capabilities was falsified. This pilot saved potentially 4 years of research on a dead-end direction by testing assumptions early.

## Future Work

**Paper 2:** How many caught examples do probes actually need?
**Paper 3:** Does fine-tuning help alignment or teach hiding?
**Paper 4:** What should AI labs do in practice?
