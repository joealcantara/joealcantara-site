I'm an AI safety researcher focused on **few-shot catastrophe prevention** — understanding what happens when we catch AI misbehavior and how to best use that information to prevent future catastrophes.

## Research Focus

My research asks: *When we catch AI doing something dangerous, what's the most effective way to use that information?*

I'm building systematic benchmarks to compare different prevention techniques (probes, fine-tuning, monitoring) and understand the fundamental tradeoffs between control and alignment.

## Current Work

I'm currently working on Paper 1: A benchmark framework for evaluating catastrophe prevention techniques. This work builds on pilot studies that validated the research direction and identified a 4-paper research arc.
